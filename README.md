# Netflix Content Analysis and Forecasting

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting Netflix's content growth over time. The objective is to understand the patterns and trends in Netflix content (Movies and TV Shows), examine how the platform's catalog has evolved over the years, and predict future content additions using time-series forecasting.

The dataset for this project is sourced from [Kaggle's Netflix Shows dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhendra7/netflix-shows) and includes metadata of Netflix's movies and TV shows, including details like release year, content type, rating, country, and more. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) along with time-series forecasting to predict the number of content releases in the coming months.

## Project Objectives

- **Content Distribution Analysis:** Understand the distribution of content types (Movies vs TV Shows) on Netflix.
- **Content Release Trends:** Analyze the trend of content releases over the years.
- **Geographical Insights:** Identify the top countries contributing the most content to Netflix.
- **Rating Analysis:** Explore the distribution of content ratings on the platform.
- **Monthly Content Additions:** Analyze how content additions fluctuate on a monthly basis.
- **Time-Series Forecasting:** Use time-series analysis to predict future Netflix content additions.

## Results

The results of the analysis and visualizations are stored in the `results` folder. In this folder, you will find various plots and insights based on the analysis performed, including the distribution of content, trends over the years, country contributions, and the time-series forecasting plot.
